I’m a software engineer with a passion for programming and learning new things. I love exploring new technologies, trying out different tools, and taking on challenging projects.
<br>
I’m currently working with NestJS and Svelte to develop solutions that improve processes and support teams at IPVC.
<br>
In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with 3D printing and electronics. I’m also a big space exploration nerd, anything involving technology fascinates me.

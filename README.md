I'm Marco, a developer currently studying computer engineering, my goal is to become a full-stack web developer. My passion for programming and the power it brings to the world is what motivates me to learn more and more.
<br>
I love doing projects that involve Arduino or Raspberry pies. I'm a big space exploration nerd, everything that involves technology fascinates me.

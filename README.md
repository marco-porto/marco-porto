I’m a software developer and software engineering student. My passion for programming and the impact it has on the world motivates me to keep learning and improving.
<br>
I’m currently working with NestJS and Svelte to develop solutions that improve processes and support teams at IPVC.
<br>
In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with 3D printing and electronics. I’m also a big space exploration nerd, anything involving technology fascinates me.
